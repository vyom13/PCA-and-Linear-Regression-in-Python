# PCA-and-Linear-Regression-in-Python

1. Use your own python PCA and linear regression modules to answer the following twoquestions.

    * (30  points)  The  data  inlinearregressiontestdata.csv contains x,y,  and yâˆ’theoretical. Perform  PCA  on x and y. Plot y vs x, y-theoretical vs x, and the PC1 axis in the same plot.  

    * (30  points)  Perform  linear  regression  on x and y with x being  the  independentvariable and y being the dependent variable.  Plot the regression line in the same plotas you obtained in (1).  Compare the PC1 axis and the regression line obtained above.Are they very different or very similar?

2.  (40 points) Perform linear regression on the diabetes dataset using sklearn.  This dataset can be accessed via the following python code:  

                                                  from sklearn import 

                                                  datasetsdiabetes = datasets.loaddiabetes() 

    and  the linear model module  in sklearncan  be  accessed  via  the  following  pythoncode:  

                                                  from sklearn import linearmodel  

    This diabetes dataset contains 10 features/variables. Selectdiabetes.data[:,2] as x for linear regression.  The dependent variable y is diabetes.target.  Split x and y into training and testing sets by randomly selecting 20 points for testing and the remaining for training.  Plot the testing x vs testing y, and the testing x vs predicted y in the same plot.
